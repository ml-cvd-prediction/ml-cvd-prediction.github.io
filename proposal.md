# Proposal

## Introduction/Background

Cardiovascular diseases, especially coronary heart disease (CHD), account for a major portion of global mortality [^1]. This has led to scientists collecting vast amount of data related to heart-disease and other conditions. With this data available, machine learning algorithms can better predict patients who are developing various kinds of diseases ranging from Diabetes to CVD [^2]. We wish to use this data and further develop unsupervised learning techniques which can help us predict the disease without any labels.

We plan to explore these two datasets:

<ol type="a">
  <li>[Cardiovascular Heart Disease Dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/dzz48mvjht/1) from the Mendeley database</li>
  <li>[Heart Disease Cleveland Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease) from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository</li>
</ol>

Both databases contains 13 features and a target variable specifying whether or not the patient was diagnosed with heart disease. They have 8 nominal values and 5 numeric values including age, blood pressure, and cholestrol levels. 

## Problem Definition
Identify a problem and motivate the need for a solution.

✅Problem

✅Motivation

## Methods
Present proposed solutions including specific data processing methods and machine learning algorithms, and elaborate on why you think each will be effective. It is recommended to identify specific functions/classes in existing packages and libraries (i.e. scikit-learn) rather than coding the algorithms from scratch.

✅3+ Data Preprocessing Methods Identified

-

✅3+ ML Algorithms/Models Identified

✅CS 7641: Unsupervised and Supervised Learning Methods Identified

✅CS 4641: Supervised or Unsupervised Learning Methods Identified (Supervised is recommended in general)

## (Potential) Results and Discussion
Identify several quantitative metrics you plan to use for the project (i.e. ML Metrics). Present goals in terms of these metrics, and state any expected results.
