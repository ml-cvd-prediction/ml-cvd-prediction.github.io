# Proposal

## Introduction/Background

Cardiovascular diseases, especially coronary heart disease (CHD), account for a major portion of global mortality [1]. This has led to scientists collecting vast amount of data related to heart-disease and other conditions. With this data available, machine learning algorithms can better predict patients who are developing various kinds of diseases ranging from Diabetes to CVD [2]. We wish to use this data and further develop unsupervised learning techniques which can help us predict the disease without any labels.

Provide an introduction of your topic and literature review of related work. Briefly explain your dataset and its features, and provide a link to the dataset if possible.

✅Literature Review

✅Dataset Description

✅Dataset Link (if applicable)

## Problem Definition
Identify a problem and motivate the need for a solution.

✅Problem

✅Motivation

## Methods
Present proposed solutions including specific data processing methods and machine learning algorithms, and elaborate on why you think each will be effective. It is recommended to identify specific functions/classes in existing packages and libraries (i.e. scikit-learn) rather than coding the algorithms from scratch.

✅3+ Data Preprocessing Methods Identified

-

✅3+ ML Algorithms/Models Identified

✅CS 7641: Unsupervised and Supervised Learning Methods Identified

✅CS 4641: Supervised or Unsupervised Learning Methods Identified (Supervised is recommended in general)

## (Potential) Results and Discussion
Identify several quantitative metrics you plan to use for the project (i.e. ML Metrics). Present goals in terms of these metrics, and state any expected results.
