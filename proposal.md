# Proposal

## Introduction/Background

Provide an introduction of your topic and literature review of related work. Briefly explain your dataset and its features, and provide a link to the dataset if possible.

✅Literature Review

✅Dataset Description

✅Dataset Link (if applicable)

## Problem Definition
Identify a problem and motivate the need for a solution.

✅Problem

✅Motivation

## Methods
Present proposed solutions including specific data processing methods and machine learning algorithms, and elaborate on why you think each will be effective. It is recommended to identify specific functions/classes in existing packages and libraries (i.e. scikit-learn) rather than coding the algorithms from scratch.

✅3+ Data Preprocessing Methods Identified

✅3+ ML Algorithms/Models Identified

✅CS 7641: Unsupervised and Supervised Learning Methods Identified

✅CS 4641: Supervised or Unsupervised Learning Methods Identified (Supervised is recommended in general)
(Potential) Results and Discussion: Identify several quantitative metrics you plan to use for the project (i.e. ML Metrics). Present goals in terms of these metrics, and state any expected results.

## (Potential) Results and Discussion
✅3+ Quantitative Metrics

✅Project Goals

✅Expected Results
