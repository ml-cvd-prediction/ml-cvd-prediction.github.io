# Final Report

## Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD), especially coronary heart disease (CHD), accounts for a major portion of global mortality [^1]. This has led to scientists collecting vast amount of data related to heart-disease and other conditions. With this data available, machine learning algorithms can better predict patients who are developing various kinds of diseases ranging from Diabetes to CVD [^2]. Research into which supervised learning techniques are best for CVD prediction is still ongoing into 2024 [^4], but we wish to also use this data to further develop unsupervised learning techniques since they can help us predict the disease without any labels.

We are exploring these two datasets:

1. [Cardiovascular Heart Disease Dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/dzz48mvjht/1) from the Mendeley database
2. [Heart Disease Cleveland Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease) from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository

Both databases contains 12 features and a target variable specifying whether or not the patient was diagnosed with heart disease. They have 6 nominal values and 6 numeric values including age, blood pressure, and cholestrol levels.

## Problem Definition

We want to use machine learning models to predict if someone has cardiovascular disease from various health metrics. Most of the prior studies [^3] focused on supervised learning algorithms for making predictions; however, our project will focus on both unsupervised and supervised learning for more comprehensive results.
