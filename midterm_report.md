# Midterm Report

## Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD), especially coronary heart disease (CHD), accounts for a major portion of global mortality [^1]. This has led to scientists collecting vast amount of data related to heart-disease and other conditions. With this data available, machine learning algorithms can better predict patients who are developing various kinds of diseases ranging from Diabetes to CVD [^2]. Research into which supervised learning techniques are best for CVD prediction is still ongoing into 2024 [^4], but we wish to also use this data to further develop unsupervised learning techniques since they can help us predict the disease without any labels.

We plan to explore these two datasets:

1. [Cardiovascular Heart Disease Dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/dzz48mvjht/1) from the Mendeley database
2. [Heart Disease Cleveland Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease) from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository

Both databases contains 13 features and a target variable specifying whether or not the patient was diagnosed with heart disease. They have 8 nominal values and 5 numeric values including age, blood pressure, and cholestrol levels. 

## Problem Definition

We want to use machine learning models to predict if someone has cardiovascular disease from various health metrics. Most of the prior studies [^3] focused on supervised learning algorithms for making predictions; however, our project will focus on both unsupervised and supervised learning for more comprehensive results.

## Methods

### Data Cleaning

In this step, we combined the Mendeley and Cleveland datasets into one. This is a mapping of all the features and what they mean:

| Feature           | Values                | 
| :---------------- | :------:              | 
| age               |   years               | 
| gender            |   0: female, 1: male    | 
| chestpain         |   0: typical angina, 1: atypical angina, 2: non-anginal pain, 3: asymptomatic   | 
| restingBP         |  94–200 mm/HG         |
| serumcholestrol   |   85-602 mg/dl        | 
| fastingbloodsugar |   0, 1 > 120 mg/dl     | 
| restingrelectro   |  0: normal, 1: ST-T wave abnormality, 2: probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria   | 
| maxheartrate      |  71 - 202    | 
| exerciseangia     |   0: no, 1: yes, whether exercise-induced angina is present   | 
| oldpeak           |   0-6.2, indicates exercise-induced ST-depression relative to the rest state   | 
| slope             |  1: upsloping, 2: flat, 3: downsloping, slope of the ST segment during peak exercise   | 
| noofmajorvessels  |  0-3   | 


We found that the patients represented in the Cleveland dataset are on average healthier than those in the Mendeley dataset (lower cholestrol, lower max heart rates, etc.), so combining the datasets makes an overall more representative dataset of different patient types. It also simplifies the number of dataset we have to apply machine learning algorithms to.

### PCA Feature Reduction Summary Report
In this step, we apply PCA to reduce the dataset’s dimensionality while preserving as much information as possible. PCA helped identify the main patterns in the data by transforming the original features into new, uncorrelated components.

Results:

Explained Variance: The first few principal components capture the majority of the variance:

PC1 captures ~17.1% of the variance.
PC2 captures ~12.4%.
PC3, PC4, and PC5 each capture between 8-11%.
The rest of the components capture less but together, the components used explain around 95% of the dataset’s variance, meaning they retain most of the information in fewer dimensions.
Feature Influence:

PC1 is most influenced by PCT, noofmajorvessels, and slope, suggesting these features contribute significantly to the data’s overall structure.
PC2 focuses on chestpain, oldpeak, and age, capturing another aspect of the data.
PC3 and PC4 also capture unique feature combinations, with PC3 highlighting gender and serumcholestrol, and PC4 focusing on PCG and maxheartrate.
Visualization Insights: The 2D scatter plot of PC1 vs. PC2 shows how observations cluster or separate in this reduced space, which can reveal patterns or relationships not easily visible in the high-dimensional data.

We found that PCA effectively reduced the dataset’s complexity, retaining the main data structure and revealing which feature combinations contribute most to each principal component. This reduction will make further analysis or modeling more efficient and focused on the most informative aspects of the data.
